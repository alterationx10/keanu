/** A typed actor with built-in immutable state management.
  *
  * StatefulActor extends TypedActor to provide both type-safe message handling
  * and managed state. The state is maintained internally and updated through
  * the statefulOnMsg method, which returns a new state for each message.
  *
  * Example:
  * {{{
  * case class CounterState(count: Int, name: String)
  *
  * sealed trait CounterMessage
  * case object Increment extends CounterMessage
  * case object Decrement extends CounterMessage
  * case class SetName(name: String) extends CounterMessage
  *
  * case class CounterActor() extends StatefulActor[CounterState, CounterMessage]:
  *   override def initialState: CounterState =
  *     CounterState(0, "default")
  *
  *   override def receive: PartialFunction[CounterMessage, CounterState] = {
  *     case Increment => state.copy(count = state.count + 1)
  *     case Decrement => state.copy(count = state.count - 1)
  *     case SetName(n) => state.copy(name = n)
  *   }
  * }}}
  *
  * State Management:
  *   - State is initialized via initialState when the actor starts
  *   - Access current state via the protected state method
  *   - Return new state from receive to update it
  *   - State is reset to initialState on actor restart
  *
  * @tparam State
  *   The type of state this actor maintains
  * @tparam Msg
  *   The message type this actor handles
